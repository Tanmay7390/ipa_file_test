# Logo Assets

Please add the following logo images to this folder:

1. **aesurg_logo.png** - The AESURG 2026 Mumbai conference logo (circular design with "Initiate Innovate Inspire" text)
2. **iaaps_logo.png** - The IAAPS (Indian Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons) logo with the shield/badge design

## Image Requirements:
- Format: PNG with transparent background (recommended)
- Size: At least 200x200 pixels (for better quality on high-resolution displays)
- Shape: Square images work best as they will be displayed in circular containers

## How to Add:
1. Save your logo images in this folder (`assets/images/`)
2. Name them exactly as:
   - `aesurg_logo.png`
   - `iaaps_logo.png`
3. The app will automatically display them in circular containers at the top of the home screen

If the images are not found, placeholder icons will be displayed instead.
